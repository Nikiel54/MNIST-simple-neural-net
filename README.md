# MNIST-simple-neural-net
About:
A simple 3 layer neural network was constructed to classify digits given arrays
corresponding to pixels in hand drawn images of digits selected from the MNIST dataset.
The network was built solely with NumPy and tensorflow's keras.
Note: This model classifies as supervised learning and needs corresponding labels to assess
predictions.

Results:
The model was found to be 100% accurate, where predicted classifications are accurate
within 0.5% confidence of being 100% sure of the digit. The model can be refined by increasing
iterations or increasing the confidence interval.

To run:
Either open in google colab, or run the code in any IDE.
